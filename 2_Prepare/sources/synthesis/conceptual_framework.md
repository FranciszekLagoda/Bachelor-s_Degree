#### Crisis vs economic crisis
There is a clear boundary between the concept of *crisis* and *economic crisis* in literature. Literature dealing with economic crises is focused on financial crises, especially 2008-2009 global financial crisis and define crises with terms like *illiquidity* and *insolvency*. In the other hand a standard crisis term is more focused on social and environmental aspects.

#### The definition
The definitions of both types of crises are similar. A crisis is a situation where decision-makers have limited time to respond to something that threatens people's values. In other words: "Something bad happens and someone has to react". According to this definition, both government-debt crises (e.g., Greece in 2007-2008) and the insolvency of financial institutions (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007-2008) are crises that threaten the value of prosperity. Additionally, wars and climate crises endanger people's lives.

#### Typologies of crises
Many authors emphasize the importance of creating typologies of crises. This is important because it is easier for both researchers and decision-makers to act when a crisis can be classified and compared to others. Some authors propose various subcategories, such as regional-human-atomic crises (e.g., the Chernobyl disaster) or global-natural-pandemic crises (e.g., COVID-19). Other authors focus on distinguishing several non-overlapping categories using concepts like *predictability* and *influenceability*. Both of these approaches seem appropriate, allowing for the creation of ready-to-use solutions based on similar crises and providing quick guides on how to react when a new crisis occurs.

#### How to measure a crisis
Measuring crises in not that easy, because the effects of crises are often incomparable, and postponed in time.
