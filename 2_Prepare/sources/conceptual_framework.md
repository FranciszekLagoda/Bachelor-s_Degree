##### Definition of crisis 
* The literature investigates different types of crisis, in different countries and over different time periods.
* The vast majority of studies (on crises) include some measure of changes in the exchange rate.[...] Exchange rate changes have often been combined with movements in reserves. (In other words, an abrupt fall in demand for a country’s currency can show up in either its value or its quantity)
* A country is considered to have been more vulnerable if it experienced larger **output drops**, bigger **stock market falls**, greater **currency weakness**, larger **losses in reserves**, or the need for **access to IMF funds**.
* An index of speculative pressure which adds interest rate increases alongside reserve loss and depreciation and defined an “exchange market crisis” as occurring when the index moves at least two standard deviations above its mean. (Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995))
* Some measures of crisis have included the drop in GDP and the drop in the equity market
* Some authors use regime switching approaches that define a crisis endogenously by simultaneously identifying speculative
attacks and the determinants of switching to speculative regimes.
##### Leading indicators
* Those results suggest that **foreign exchange reserves**, the **real exchange rate**, the **growth rate of credit**, **GDP** and the **current account** are the most frequent statistically significant indicators. 
* Measures of **reserves** and of the **real exchange rate** in particular stand out as easily
the top two most important leading indicators, showing up as statistically significant determinants of crisis incidence.
* A second contribution came from the papers by Rose and Spiegel (2009a; 2009b). They modeled crisis incidence as a combination of 2008 changes in **real GDP**, the **stock market**, **country credit ratings** and the **exchange rate**.

#### **Conclusions**
* Possible crisis measures:
  * Nominal local currency percentage change versus the US dollar
  * Equity market returns
  * Percentage change in the level of real GDP
  * Percentage change in industrial production
  * Recourse to IMF financing
* **International reserves** and **real exchange rate overvaluation**, the top two indicators identified in the review, stood out as useful leading indicators of the more recent crisis.
* Lower **past credit growth**, larger current **accounts/saving rates**, and lower external and short-term **debt** were associated with lower crisis incidence.

#### About
* **Tittle**: I (Could Have) Told You! Early warning indicators and crisis performance of the 12 “old” Euro-countries under the economic crisis 2008–09.
* **Author**: Peter Nannestad
* **Year**: 2020
* **Link**: https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2020.101899
* **Description**: Early warning indicators comparison between: economic, political and optimal currency areas. Presents a statistical analyze, which results in a "seriousness of crises" both predicted and observed.
#### **Quotes**:
* First, it (this study) focuses on post-predicting crisis performance, while mainstream literature on early warning indicators typically focuses on post-predicting crisis occurrence. In that respect, the present study is more ambitious than typical mainstream studies.
##### Dependent variable
* Economic crisis performance is measured using the 2008-09 averages of five economic indicators: 
  * government consolidated debt (in % of GDP),
  * general government financial deficit (in % of GDP), 
  * unemployment (in %), 
  * current account (in % of GDP), 
  * and the long-term interest rate (yield on government bonds with a maturity of ten years)
* The correlation between the countries’ economic performance scores with and without GDP-growth included are r ¼ 0.9984, so it does not really matter if GDP-growth is included among the indicators of crisis performance.
* PCA of five indicators of economic crisis performance.
##### Independent indicators
* As economic indicators, I use the 95–98 averages of:
  * general government debt, 
  * general government budget surplus, 
  * the long-term interest rate (yield on government bonds with a maturity of ten years),
  * the current account (% of GDP),
  * average of the unemployment rate,
  * consumer price inflation.
* Kaufman et al. (2010: 2–3) define governance as “the traditions and institutions by which authority is exercised”. These they break down into three dimensions:
  * the process by which those in authority are selected and replaced with the twin indicators “voice and accountability”, “political stability and absence of violence”, 
  * the capacity of government to formulate and implement policies, with the twin indicators “government effectiveness” and “regulatory quality
  * the respect of citizens and state for institutions that govern interactions among them, with the twin indicators “rule of law” and “control of corruption”
#### **Conclusions**:
* It is possible to post-predict the economic crisis performance of the 'old' member countries in the Euro-zone.
* Government indicators are more important than economic indicators and the optimal currency areas theory is the least important.
