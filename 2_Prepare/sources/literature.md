##### Definition of crisis 
* The literature investigates different types of crisis, in different countries and over different time periods.
* The vast majority of studies (on crises) include some measure of changes in the exchange rate.[...] Exchange rate changes have often been combined with movements in reserves. (In other words, an abrupt fall in demand for a country’s currency can show up in either its value or its quantity)
* A country is considered to have been more vulnerable if it experienced larger **output drops**, bigger **stock market falls**, greater **currency weakness**, larger **losses in reserves**, or the need for **access to IMF funds**.
* An index of speculative pressure which adds interest rate increases alongside reserve loss and depreciation and defined an “exchange market crisis” as occurring when the index moves at least two standard deviations above its mean. (Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995))
* Some measures of crisis have included the drop in GDP and the drop in the equity market
* Some authors use regime switching approaches that define a crisis endogenously by simultaneously identifying speculative
attacks and the determinants of switching to speculative regimes.
##### Leading indicators
* Those results suggest that **foreign exchange reserves**, the **real exchange rate**, the **growth rate of credit**, **GDP** and the **current account** are the most frequent statistically significant indicators. 
* Measures of **reserves** and of the **real exchange rate** in particular stand out as easily
the top two most important leading indicators, showing up as statistically significant determinants of crisis incidence.
* A second contribution came from the papers by Rose and Spiegel (2009a; 2009b). They modeled crisis incidence as a combination of 2008 changes in **real GDP**, the **stock market**, **country credit ratings** and the **exchange rate**.

#### **Conclusions**
* Possible crisis measures:
  * Nominal local currency percentage change versus the US dollar
  * Equity market returns
  * Percentage change in the level of real GDP
  * Percentage change in industrial production
  * Recourse to IMF financing
* **International reserves** and **real exchange rate overvaluation**, the top two indicators identified in the review, stood out as useful leading indicators of the more recent crisis.
* Lower **past credit growth**, larger current **accounts/saving rates**, and lower external and short-term **debt** were associated with lower crisis incidence.
