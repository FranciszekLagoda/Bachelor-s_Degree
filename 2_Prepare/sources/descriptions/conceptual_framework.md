* **Description**: Author analyze early warning indicators and extract variables that are consistently useful in predicting impact of financial crisis basing on 2008-09 crisis. 
#### **Quotes**
##### Definition of crisis 
* The literature investigates different types of crisis, in different countries and over different time periods.
* The vast majority of studies (on crises) include some measure of changes in the exchange rate.[...] Exchange rate changes have often been combined with movements in reserves. (In other words, an abrupt fall in demand for a country’s currency can show up in either its value or its quantity)
* A country is considered to have been more vulnerable if it experienced larger **output drops**, bigger **stock market falls**, greater **currency weakness**, larger **losses in reserves**, or the need for **access to IMF funds**.
* An index of speculative pressure which adds interest rate increases alongside reserve loss and depreciation and defined an “exchange market crisis” as occurring when the index moves at least two standard deviations above its mean. (Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995))
* Some measures of crisis have included the drop in GDP and the drop in the equity market
* Some authors use regime switching approaches that define a crisis endogenously by simultaneously identifying speculative
attacks and the determinants of switching to speculative regimes.
##### Leading indicators
* Those results suggest that **foreign exchange reserves**, the **real exchange rate**, the **growth rate of credit**, **GDP** and the **current account** are the most frequent statistically significant indicators. 
* Measures of **reserves** and of the **real exchange rate** in particular stand out as easily
the top two most important leading indicators, showing up as statistically significant determinants of crisis incidence.
* A second contribution came from the papers by Rose and Spiegel (2009a; 2009b). They modeled crisis incidence as a combination of 2008 changes in **real GDP**, the **stock market**, **country credit ratings** and the **exchange rate**.

#### **Conclusions**
* Possible crisis measures:
  * Nominal local currency percentage change versus the US dollar
  * Equity market returns
  * Percentage change in the level of real GDP
  * Percentage change in industrial production
  * Recourse to IMF financing
* **International reserves** and **real exchange rate overvaluation**, the top two indicators identified in the review, stood out as useful leading indicators of the more recent crisis.
* Lower **past credit growth**, larger current **accounts/saving rates**, and lower external and short-term **debt** were associated with lower crisis incidence.


### nannestad2020
* **Tittle**: I (Could Have) Told You! Early warning indicators and crisis performance of the 12 “old” Euro-countries under the economic crisis 2008–09.
* **Author**: Peter Nannestad
* **Year**: 2020
* **Link**: https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2020.101899
* **Description**: Early warning indicators comparison between: economic, political and optimal currency areas. Presents a statistical analyze, which results in a "seriousness of crises" both predicted and observed.
#### **Quotes**:
* First, it (this study) focuses on post-predicting crisis performance, while mainstream literature on early warning indicators typically focuses on post-predicting crisis occurrence. In that respect, the present study is more ambitious than typical mainstream studies.
##### Dependent variable
* Economic crisis performance is measured using the 2008-09 averages of five economic indicators: 
  * government consolidated debt (in % of GDP),
  * general government financial deficit (in % of GDP), 
  * unemployment (in %), 
  * current account (in % of GDP), 
  * and the long-term interest rate (yield on government bonds with a maturity of ten years)
* The correlation between the countries’ economic performance scores with and without GDP-growth included are r ¼ 0.9984, so it does not really matter if GDP-growth is included among the indicators of crisis performance.
* PCA of five indicators of economic crisis performance.
##### Independent indicators
* As economic indicators, I use the 95–98 averages of:
  * general government debt, 
  * general government budget surplus, 
  * the long-term interest rate (yield on government bonds with a maturity of ten years),
  * the current account (% of GDP),
  * average of the unemployment rate,
  * consumer price inflation.
* Kaufman et al. (2010: 2–3) define governance as “the traditions and institutions by which authority is exercised”. These they break down into three dimensions:
  * the process by which those in authority are selected and replaced with the twin indicators “voice and accountability”, “political stability and absence of violence”, 
  * the capacity of government to formulate and implement policies, with the twin indicators “government effectiveness” and “regulatory quality
  * the respect of citizens and state for institutions that govern interactions among them, with the twin indicators “rule of law” and “control of corruption”
#### **Conclusions**:
* It is possible to post-predict the economic crisis performance of the 'old' member countries in the Euro-zone.
* Government indicators are more important than economic indicators and the optimal currency areas theory is the least important.

* **Tittle**: Early Warning Systems: A Survey and a Regime-Switching Approach
* **Author**: Abiad, Abdul
* **Year**: 2003
* **Link**: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0332.pdf
* **Description**: Author examine crisis indicators using Markov-switching model focusing on exchange rates. Author uses country-by-country approach.
#### **Quotes**:
* The most known procedure for making early warning models is taking changes in exchange rates, reserves, and/or interest rates, choosing wages on each and combining them into an index of speculative pressure. This  threshold procedure (for identifying approaching crises) provides a set of crisis dates, but rises even more problems. First [...(A threshold procedure)] is arbitrary, second futer data can affect identification of past crises (because of use of e.g standard deviation). Third arbitrary is a time period when a crisis is a new one.
* Alternative approach using Markov-switching model can adres those issues. It based on assumption that in "tranquil states" indicators have different meaning then in "speculative attack" periods. In this approach it is crucial to identify when a given country is changing his state.
#### **Conclusions**:
* Exchange rates are an important indicator of a crisis.
* Different indicators matter for different countries, so parameters consistency may contribute to poor performance.

* **Year**: 2005
* **Link**: https://theisrm.org/documents/Gundel%20%282005%29%20Towards%20a%20New%20Topology%20of%20Crises.pdf
* **Description**: Author review typologies of crises and creates a new typology based on predictability and influence possibilities.
#### **Quotes**:
* A crisis typology should allow for the **clear allocation** of all actual and forthcoming crises to only **one of mutually exclusive classes** and should furthermore **facilitate the handling** of crises.
* The review of the typologies used today  
*(human/natural(human1,human2 etc.) or global/local + long/short + natural/human ...)*   
has proved that it is very difficult to allocate all types of possible crises to a manageable number of mutually exclusive classes with the analysis framework available at present. [...] The main problem seems to be the use of quite narrow classification criteria which are often expected to reduce the need for interpretation but make typologies static, impending time-invariant application when new events arise.
* Some information be completely understood after the event took
place and so the idea of a definable incubation
period is no appropriate illustration of reality
(Gephart, 1984).
* A crisis is predictable, if place, time or in particular the manner of its occurrence are knowable to at least a third competent party and the probability of occurrence is not to be neglected.
* A disaster or crisis can be influenced if responses to stem the tide or to reduce damages by antagonizing the causes of a crisis are known and possible to execute. [...] In other words, R (ck) should be well-known and practical application of them should be proved and tested.
* A detailed discussion of the proposed countermeasures can however be found in Gundel (2004).

* **Description**: Authors present definitions of crisis and...
#### **Quotes**:
##### **Definition of crisis**
* Crisis and conflicts erupt from change in the environment. Crisis and conflicts generate change in state behavior. And crisis and conflicts often lead to change in international system.
* (Hermann 1969) A Crisis is a situation that:
  *  threatens high-priority goals of the decision-making unit,
  *  restricts the amount of time available for response before the decision is transformed,
  *  and surprises the members of the decision-making unit by its occurrence.
Decision making process depends on number of this characteristics.
* (This book) differences:
  * The omission of "surprise",
  * *"Short"* time to response into *"finite"*,
  * The recognition that crisis may originate in the internal and external environment,
  * *"Basic values"* rather then *"high-priority goals"*,
  * The addition of *"higher-then-normal probability of involvement in military hostilities"* (war)
* The distinction between crisis and protracted conflict. The focus of crisis is a single issue. Protracted conflict is a hostile interaction
