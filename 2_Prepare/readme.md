# Prepare
The second step of analysis involves finding the necessary data, identifying how it's organized, and determining its credibility. In the context of scientific research, this involves finding adequate literature and high-value data.

## Roadmap
1. Identify the essential keywords
2. Find and store adequate scientific papers
3. Collect statistic data and store it appropriately
4. Determine the credibility of the data

## 1. Identify the essential keywords
Keywords are important when searching for scientific papers in scientific databases. I have grouped keyword based on categories. 
### International Trade
International Trade, Trade, WTO, World Trade Organization
### Polish Trade
Polish Trade, Polish export, Polish import
### Economic crisis
Lagging Indicators, Economic Indicators, Financial Crisis, Causes of Crisis, GDP, Gross Domestic Product, Inflation, crisis, early warning, emerging markets, financial crisis, leading indicators, business cycle

## 2. Find and store adequate scientific papers
Sources are stored in .bib format [here](/2_Prepare/sources/literature.bib) and all sources are described in a .md file [here](/2_Prepare/sources). Each file contains literature about a different sub-theme of this project.

## 3. Collect statistic data and store it appropriately
Prepared databases are described [here](/2_Prepare/sources/databases.md).  
I used this databases:
