# Ask
The first point of analysis involves identifying key questions that are essential for examining a specific phenomenon. In the context of scientific research methodology, this involves asking research questions and formulating hypotheses.

## Roadmap
1. Determine key stakeholders
2. Main research question
3. Complementary research questions
4. Find research hypotheses

## Determine key stakeholders
The goal of scientific research is to provide new, objective knowledge about the world, which can serve as the foundation for other research papers and inform decision-making by public and private entities. This approach ensures a high level of information verification, the use of scientific literature, and compliance with formal requirements for writing bachelor's theses [link](https://www.ue.wroc.pl/p/bg/standardy_pracy_dyplomowej_licencjackiej_zal1.pdf). Because of these requirements, the final paper will be in Polish; however, to enhance accessibility, the process of data analysis will be conducted in English.

## Main Research Question
How do Polish exports and imports respond to economic crises in selected third countries, and what factors determine the differences in these responses?

## Complementary Research Questions
* What is an economic crisis in a country? How to recognize it?
* What are the different types of economic crises?
* Which countries have a sufficiently intense trade exchange with Poland to be suitable for effective analysis?
* Which countries meet the criteria for trade volume and the occurrence of a crisis?
* What was the overall trend in the differences between import and export responses to the crisis?
* Does crisis type impact on this trend?
* Were there regularities in terms of changes in the structure of exports and imports?
* Can information on changes in export to import ratios serve as a predictor of economic crisis?

## Research Hypotheses
* Economic crises in third countries have a direct impact on changes in the value of Polish exports to those countries, where a decrease in exports is observed in response to the crisis.
* The response of Polish imports to an economic crisis in a third country is less sensitive than the response of exports, leading to the development of a trade deficit during crises.
* There is a significant difference in the commodity structure of Polish exports and imports in response to economic crises in third countries, which may lead to changes in dominant sectors of the economy.
* Changes in the level of exports and imports can act as early warning signals for potential economic crises in Poland, allowing for earlier preventive measures to be taken.
